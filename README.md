# k-NN Decision Boundary for IRIS Dataset

This project visualizes the decision boundaries of k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifiers on the IRIS dataset using two features. We explore the decision boundaries for k=1 and k=5.

## Introduction

The IRIS dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning, often used for testing and benchmarking classification algorithms. In this project, we use the first two features of the dataset to visualize how k-NN classifiers with different values of k (1 and 5) separate the data into three classes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Ensure you have these libraries installed. You can install them using pip if they are not already installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
